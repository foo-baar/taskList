Create a Task List.

NOTE: Before starting click the blue _Fork_ button. This will allow you to save your changes.

Step 1:
Using Angular 5 create a form where a user can enter a task name and click a save button.
Once the button is clicked the textfield should clear and the task should appear in a list below the form.

ex:

___________ [Save]

- Task1
- Task2
- Task3

Step 2:
Add a link to each task to allow you to remove the item.

ex:

___________ [Save]

- Task1 [remove]
- Task2 [remove]
- Task3 [remove]

Step 3:
Add a dropdown with priority to the form with the values:
* High
* Medium
* Low
The list should sort the tasks by priority.

ex:

___________ [Priority v ] [Save]

- Task1 (High) [remove]
- Task2 (Medium) [remove]
- Task3 (Low) [remove]
